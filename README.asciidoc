This repository contains scripts and instructions for upgrading a Fusion deployment.

There are two separate sets of scripts, in directories `src` and `bin`.

* The `src` directory is used to upgrade Fusion 2.1 to Fusion 2.4.
It contains a Python program which rewrites Fusion datasource configurations automatically:
https://github.com/lucidworks/fusion-upgrade-scripts/tree/master/src[upgrade-ds-2.1-to-2.4.py]

* The `bin` directory is used to upgrade Fusion 1.2 to Fusion 2.1.
It contains a Python script
https://github.com/lucidworks/fusion-upgrade-scripts/tree/master/bin[download_upload_ds_pipelines.py] which
rewrites Fusion datasource and pipeline configurations in order to encode any stored passwords needed for those datasources.
This script uses packages http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install[requests] and https://kazoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html[kazoo], which are an HTTP request handler and ZooKeeper client, respectively.
If for some reason, the user running the upgrade scripts doesn't have install permissions, use Python's http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/[virtualenv].
It also contains a Java utility to rewrite Fusion crawldb repositories:
