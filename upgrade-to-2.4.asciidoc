== Python version and packages

The script which runs this utility is "src/upgrade-ds-2.1-to-2.4.py".
It requires Python version 2.7 and has only been tested in Python 2.7.10.
If this version of Python isn't available, you should use Python's
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/[virtualenv].

This script uses the following python packages:

* https://kazoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html[kazoo] - a ZooKeeper client.

If you don't have permissions to install packages, you can use python to install virtualenv and then
from your virtualenv python environment, you can install your own versions of theses packages.
