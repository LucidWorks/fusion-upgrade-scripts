== Python version and packages

The script 'download_upload_ds.py' runs under Python 2.7.
If this version of Python isn't available, you should use Python's
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/[virtualenv].

This script uses the following python packages:

* https://kazoo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html[kazoo] - a ZooKeeper client.
* http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install[requests] - an HTTP request handler.

If you don't have permissions to install packages, you can use python to install virtualenv and then
from your virtualenv python environment, you can install your own versions of theses packages.
